			 spserver/win32 README

spserver/win32 is a TCP server framework library written in C++ based on IOCP.

spserver implements the Half-Sync/Half-Async patterns. It uses a single thread
to process IO (the async layer), and a thread pool to process the service
logic (the sync layer, the long time duration work can be done here).

You can get the code from the spserver home page:

Any and all comments are appreciated.

Enjoy!
